    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka is a one pan dish. Eggs are a must, everything else changes with the seasons–add potatoes during winter and aubergines in spring. The hero in ours is slow-cooked, gently spiced tomatoes and peppers—the perfect bed for your eggs. It's been a favourite in our delis since day dot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>190 ml light olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large onions, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>2 red peppers, cored and cut into 2 cm strips</li>
            <li>2 yellow peppers, cored and cut into 2 cm strips</li>
            <li>4 tsp muscovado sugar</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>6 sprigs thyme, picked and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh coriander, chopped</li>
            <li>6 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>½ tsp saffron strands</li>
            <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>250 ml water</li>
            <li>8 free-range eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saucepan, dry-roast the cumin on high heat for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the oil and sauté the onions for two minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the peppers, sugar, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, and two tablespoons of coriander. Cook on high heat until they develop a nice colour.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, saffron, cayenne, salt, and pepper. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes, adding enough water to maintain a pasta sauce consistency. Taste and adjust the seasoning; it should be potent and flavoursome. This mixture can be prepared in advance.</li>
            <li>Place four saucepans on medium heat and divide the mixture between them. Break two eggs into each pan, pouring them into gaps in the mixture.</li>
